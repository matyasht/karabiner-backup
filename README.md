Remaps modifier keys on MacOS to Windows-like and makes sure that the following still work like Windows muscle memory:
- Alt + Tab -> switch application
- Control + Backspace -> backward delete word
- Alt + Q -> @
- Control + Arrow keys -> word wise navigation

Profiles need to be switched depending on whether the internal or an external keyboard is used to make sure that the layout is correct (e.g. <> key) and modifier keys work correctly.
